Pre-onboarding preparation:   - Prepare a welcome package with team norms, agile practices, and project overview   - Set up necessary accounts and access rights   - Assign a mentor from the existing team members2. Day 1: Welcome and Introduct   - Team welcome and introductions   - Overview of the project, product backlog, and current sprint goal   - Set up the developer's workstation   - Pair the new developer with their mentor for initial guidance3. Week 1: Agile Immersion   - Include the new developer in all Scrum events (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, review, retrospective)   - Assign them as an observer in the current sprint   - Provide basic training on your agile tools (e.g.,   - Have them pair program with different team members to understand the codebase4. Sprint Integration:   - In the next sprint planning, include the new developer in estimation   - Assign them small, manageable tasks paired with a more experienced developer   - Use pair programming to accelerate learning and maintain quality   - Don't count their full capacity in sprint velocity calculations initially5. Gradual Responsibility Increase:   - Week 2-3: Assign slightly larger stories, still paired with experienced developers   - Week 4+: Begin assigning independent tasks, starting with lower complexity items6. Knowledge Transfer:   - Schedule short, focused knowledge transfer sessions on key areas of the project   - Encourage the new developer to document their learning for future team members   - Use code reviews as a learning opportunity7. Maintaining Velocity:   - Initially, slightly reduce the team's commitment in sprint plann   - Use the 'new developer buffer' - extra time allocated for onboarding activities   - Gradually increase the new developer's expected contribution over 3-4 sprints8. Regular Check-ins:   - Daily qui   - Weekly one-on-ones with the Scrum Master or team lead   - Address any concerns or blockers promptly9. Agile Best Practices:   - Encourage questions during   - Use pair programming rotations to spread knowledge   - Involve the new developer in refining the backlog to build product knowledge10. Team Integration:    - Include the new dev    - Encourage them to share their fresh perspective in retrospectives    - Celebrate their first completed story with the team11. Continuous Feedback:    - Provide regular, co    - Seek feedback from the new developer on the onboarding process    - Adjust the onboarding plan based on the developer's pace and team needs12. Velocity Monitoring:    - Track the team's velocity closely over the first few sprints    - Adjust sprint commitments as needed based on the team's new capacity    - Expect full integration and velocity stabilization within 3-4 sprintsRemember, a short-term dip in velocity is normal and acceptable when onboarding new team members. The goal is to integrate the new developer effectively while minimizing disruption to the team's flow. With this approach, you should see the new developer contributing significantly within a few sprints, and your team's velocity should stabilize and potentially increase with the additional capacity."

What will I do today?     3. Are there any impediments in my way?2. Timeboxing:   - Strictly limit the stand-up to 15 minutes   -    - Assign a timekeeper role (rotate this responsibility)3. Stand-up Format:   - Actually stand up to create a sense of urgency   - For remote teams, use v   - Consider a walk-the-board approach, focusing on work items rather than individuals4. Participation Guidelines:   - Encourage brief, focused updates   - Discourage detailed techni   - Use a token (like a small ball) to indicate who should speak, passing it after each update5. Address Impediments:   - Note blockers without diving into solutions   - Schedule separate meetings for prob   - Assign someone to follow up on each impediment after the stand-up6. Use Visual Aids:   - Reference the team's Kanban or Scrum board during updates   - Use this to focus on work progress, not j7. Start on Time:   - Begin the meeting promptly, even if some members are missing   - Cultivate a culture of punctuality8. Parking Lot:   - Create a 'parking lot' for discussions that go beyond the stand-up's scope   - Address these items immediately after the stand-up with relevant team members9. Remote Considerations:   - Use a reliable video conferenc   - Ensure all remote participants can see the Scrum/Kanban board   - Establish a speaking order to prevent talking over each other10. Preparation:    - Encourage team members to pr    - Use a shared document or tool where updates can be drafted in advance11. Focus on Collaboration:    - Highlight areas where team members can help each other    - Encourage offers of assistance for block12. Regular Review:    - Periodically ask the team for feedback on the stand-up process    - Use a quick poll or discuss in sprint retrospectives    - Be willing t13.

Knowledge Transfer:   - Schedule short, focused knowledge transfer sessions on key areas of the project   - Encourage the new developer to document their learning for future team members   - Use code reviews as a learning opportunity7. Maintaining Velocity:   - Initially, slightly reduce the team's commitment in sprint plann   - Use the 'new developer buffer' - extra time allocated for onboarding activities   - Gradually increase the new developer's expected contribution over 3-4 sprints8. Regular Check-ins:   - Daily qui   - Weekly one-on-ones with the Scrum Master or team lead   - Address any concerns or blockers promptly9. Agile Best Practices:   - Encourage questions during   - Use pair programming rotations to spread knowledge   - Involve the new developer in refining the backlog to build product knowledge10. Team Integration:    - Include the new dev    - Encourage them to share their fresh perspective in retrospectives    - Celebrate their first completed story with the team11. Continuous Feedback:    - Provide regular, co    - Seek feedback from the new developer on the onboarding process    - Adjust the onboarding plan based on the developer's pace and team needs12. Velocity Monitoring:    - Track the team's velocity closely over the first few sprints    - Adjust sprint commitments as needed based on the team's new capacity    - Expect full integration and velocity stabilization within 3-4 sprintsRemember, a short-term dip in velocity is normal and acceptable when onboarding new team members. The goal is to integrate the new developer effectively while minimizing disruption to the team's flow. With this approach, you should see the new developer contributing significantly within a few sprints, and your team's velocity should stabilize and potentially increase with the additional capacity."
